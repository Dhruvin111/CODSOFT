# Calculator and Weather App Project
This project consists of a Calculator and Weather App implemented in Python. The project aims to provide two distinct functionalities within a single application: basic arithmetic calculations and fetching weather information based on user input.


Calculator:
The Calculator component enables users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It supports both integer and floating-point numbers, and it handles scenarios involving division by zero. The user interface is designed to be intuitive and straightforward.

Weather App:
The Weather App allows users to fetch real-time weather information for a specific city. It displays essential data, including the current temperature, weather conditions, and a brief description. The app gracefully manages errors that might arise due to incorrect city names or connectivity issues.
